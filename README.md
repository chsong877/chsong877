- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m 20202057 ì†¡ì°¬í˜¸
- My project is aiming for changing the original shmup game into a new version of the game, called "Crazy Arcade shmup."
  The original background was changed into the new Crazy Arcade village theme, and the bullet was also changed into water balloons.
  And the sound effect was also revised. It used water balloon's popping sound effect, and the classic original theme song of Crazy Arcade game.
  The fireballs, which were originally seen like chicken legs were also changed into normal ones.
  I hope this revision works. Thank you.
